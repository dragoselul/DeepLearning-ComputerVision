    "Mean AP comes from taking the mean of all AP for the different classes which is a popular metric for object detection. AP for a class is important as it measures a high precision and recall at the same time. It is important to have both as the object detection model otherwise can game the metrics. For instance, by only looking at recall, the model can make extremely many wild guesses where it can get all ground truths, while only looking at precision it can only consider those it's extremely confident about, but miss a lot of other ground truths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm for this project takes all predictions from all images with their confidence and boxes and sorts predictions based on confidence. This is favorable for AP to get as many true positives as we can in the beginning. When matching the image, IoU is checked to find a Ground truth. Lastly, in this pothole project the only class is pothole, meaning the outcome is AP for pothole across all images.\n"
